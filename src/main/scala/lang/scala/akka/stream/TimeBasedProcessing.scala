/**
 *  One aspect that is not immediately visible deserves mention, though: if you try and
 *  set the streams to produce a billion numbers each then you will notice that your JVM
 *  does not crash with an OutOfMemoryError, even though you will also notice that
 *  running the streams happens in the background, asynchronously (this is the reason
 *  for the auxiliary information to be provided as a Future). The secret that makes
 *  this work is that Akka Streams implicitly implement pervasive flow control,
 *  all combinators respect back-pressure. This allows the throttle combinator to signal
 *  to all its upstream sources of data that it can only accept elements at a certain
 *  rateâ€”when the incoming rate is higher than one per second the throttle combinator
 *  will assert back-pressure upstream.
